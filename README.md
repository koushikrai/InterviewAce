# Problem Statement: 

 Many job seekers face significant challenges in effectively preparing for job interviews and
 optimizing their resumes. While resources like interview guides and online tutorials offer
 some support, they often lack the personalization and real-time feedback necessary for
 substantial improvement. Traditional methods provide generic advice, failing to address
 the specific requirements of diverse job roles, industries, and individual candidate profiles.
 Job seekers often struggle to identify the precise skills and qualifications that employers
 seek in their target roles and are unsure how to best showcase their own skills and
 experience to align with those expectations.
 There is currently no unified solution that combines dynamic, AI-driven interview practice
 with in-depth, resume analysis and personalized feedback. The absence of such a platform
 limits job seekersâ€™ ability to confidently present themselves, effectively communicate their
 qualifications, and tailor their applications to specific opportunities. This deficiency
 hinders their ability to compete effectively in the job market, potentially leading to missed
 opportunities and prolonged periods of unemployment.
 This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a smart, automated system that offers
 personalized interview practice, resume-based career guidance, and intelligent feedback.
 The platform will empower job seekers to target their preparation, refine their application
 materials, and ultimately improve their chances of securing their desired positions.


 ## Core Features:

- Resume Analyzer: Semantic analysis tool compares a resume against a job description, identifying gaps and areas for improvement, offering data-driven suggestions. The tool also generates scores that measure alignment. The tool needs to reason whether or not to include certain pieces of information, so it is a tool.
- Interview Question Generator: The system will leverage NLP to generate interview questions that dynamically adapt to the selected job role and the specifics of the uploaded resume. A tool configures realistic interview simulations. The tool needs to reason whether or not to include certain pieces of information, so it is a tool.
- AI Feedback Engine: Provides scoring, corrections and follow-up questions after evaluating user responses (text or voice), giving detailed and suggestive feedback. The tool needs to reason whether or not to include certain pieces of information, so it is a tool.
- Gaps Display: The web displays intuitive summaries of detected gaps with clear, actionable, step-by-step recommendations and a way to download the result.
- Progress Visualization: A dashboard visualizes the interview score for each session, showing user trends, and clearly highlighting skill improvements over time.
- Secure Authentication: Utilize secure JWT authentication for safe API calls and protection of user data.
